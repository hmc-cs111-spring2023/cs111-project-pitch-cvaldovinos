## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

At a high level, I would like to feel that I can apply the skills I have learned from this class to design and implement other DSLs after having finished this project. While this might not be something that I need to do, I would appreciate having a clearer sense of what the process is like for implementing a DSL of my own design than I currently have. This would allow me to come away from this class feeling that I can create things which I appreciate the value of, and thus I will have a new skill that I can later use if needed.

Many classes require doing a predefined final project or exams to test skills and though these can be useful methods for evaluating the students' grasp of key concepts, it does not provide the sense of satisfaction and feeling of truly understanding the value of knowing those concepts. Also, this project allows us to make something that is much more abstract and that is why I appreciate the fact that this project is from scratch, with us designing our language, choosing the concepts we would like to work on, and setting our own learning expectations.

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

I would like to work on external DSLs. While we have convered these conceptually in class, I found myself more challenged understanding how they work and what it would look like to implement one. Even for the PicoBot assignment, I experienced many difficulties so I felt pressured by time to use an internal DSL as that is what I felt I had a clearer understaning on and that I could confidently work with. 

Thus, I am somewhat biased towards challenging myself to take on an external DSL approach for this project so that I can ensure I understand what that implementation entails. Since I had difficulties understanding how external DSLs work, I think that by implementing one I will be able to really clear up and demysticize my understanding of external DSLs. However, I will first need to review the lessons on external DSLs, such as "Programs, interpreters, and compilers", to clear up any background information I will need going into beginning my implementation.

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

I plan to set aside time on Wednesday afternoons to work on the project. I think this will be useful because it will come after our studio sessions on Wednesday and I have been experiencing more issues with context switching (jumping from one class' work to another) recently so by having longer continuous blocks of time dedicated to working on the project I will have less issues with getting started or worrying about other asssignments. Additionally, I do not have classes after this or assignments due usually after Tuesdays, just a meeting in the late evening so I should be free of other time-sensitive pressures during these periods.

I think that the intermediate milestones will be very dependent on how I get started but for my short term goals I would like to have an implementation by the end of this upcoming week (end of 3/31) so that way I can begin the process of designing the DSL in a general purpose programming language and my ideal example in my DSL by the Critique day the following week (start of class 4/3). Relating this back to the project planning discussed in class, this would be the start of the two ends of the bridge that will connect my ideal design to the current method of writing it and closing the gap between the two.

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

To make sure that I can give consistent and actionable feedback to other people in the class, I will make sure that I look at their work relative to their plan and what recent changes have been made. While we often like to fram the work of others relative to that of ours, this is not always helpful. In fact, it can be particularly negative for a project like this where we each are working on nonlinear scales. Also, reflecting on the question of Concepts / Skills, a concept which I may have found intutitive may have been more of a struggle for others. Keeping these factors in mind, I think I can provide more consistent, useful feedback to others. 

To ensure that my feedback is also actionable, thinking back to the discussions we had at the beginning of the semester, I think it's always important to provide the feedback in a respectful manner such that the other is receptive towards it. Secondly, I aim to provide criticism that is clear so that way the other person has clear understanding of what I am reccommending and they can decide whether they want to edit that aspect or not.

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

At the end of the semester, I would be proud to tell others that I created a programming language for financial calculations. While I don't think this is something I would really be able to show to anyone to use since I don't know many people who I would tell about my project that would also be users of it, it is something that I think is understandable even to non-users to say that my DSL allows you to do finance calculations and they could understand how that could be useful to someone.

More generally, I think I would be proud to share this not because I think making finance calculator languages is particularly exciting but rather because it is exciting to be able to demonstrate that I was able to identify a problem and create a new solution, which the most people can appreciate. I think this is also related back to what I would like to get out of this assignment because I would like to be able to come away from this project feeling proud to share this new set of skills, including designing, implementing, and revising to create something nearly independently.

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

I would consider an A- for my project to be one which fulfills my goal of challenging myself to meet user needs and allows me to get a functional finance calculator which allows users to follow a flow similar to that of the existing tools they are used to, with some minor design changes which allow me to explore language design.

I would consider an A for my project to be one which allows me to learn about the concepts that I currently do not fully understand, even if they are not necessarily used in my implementation, because it will lead into my description in the success section of allowing me to come away with something that I think taught me valuable skills and thus feel confident to be able to do again in the future if I would like to follow the same process and implement another similar tool.
